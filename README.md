 ## Why arent the docs better?

I open sourced this for portfolio building, not script kiddies.

A competent dev should be able to get this working in a jiffy if theyre that interested.

best scripts:
- [High Alch bot](./high-alch.py)
- [NMZ Bot](./nmz_prayer_flick.py) (absorption/health manager)
- [Construction bot](./mahogany_table.py) (builds mahogany tables, designed for use in rimmington)
